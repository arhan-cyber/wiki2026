              <p style={{ marginBottom: 2 }}>
                Safety was integrated into every stage of our project, from selecting the production organism to designing the final
                bio-coolant. As our project combines synthetic biology with chemical formulation, we considered both
                <b> biosafety during microbial engineering</b> and <b>product safety for the intended coolant application.</b>
              </p>
              <p style={{ marginBottom: 12 }}>
                Our project uses genetically engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae solely as a microbial production platform for
                synthesizing bio-based coolant components. In addition, we use Escherichia coli for plasmid replication. The engineered
                microorganisms are strictly confined to laboratory conditions and will be separated out for the{' '}
                <b>final coolant formulation</b>, ensuring that the final product poses no GMO-related risk during transportation,
                handling, or use

              <p>
                Since our project involves the genetic engineering of S.cerevisiae for the biosynthesis of methyl myristate, biosafety
                considerations were incorporated throughout the experimental workflow to ensure the safety of laboratory personnel and
                prevent unintended environmental release.

              <h3>Compliance with iGEM Safety Standards</h3>
              <ul style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
                <li>
                  The biological chassis and genetic components used in this project were selected in accordance with the
                  <span className={styles.semi}> iGEM Safety and Security Programme</span> and
                  <span className={styles.semi}> the iGEM White List</span>.

                <li>
                  Only <span className={styles.semi}>non-pathogenic laboratory strains of S. cerevisiae and E. coli</span> were used
                  throughout the project. The production of lipids and fatty acids are enhanced under nitrogen-starvation of the
                  organism. While it is in our best interest to do this, this is stressful to the organism and leads to spore formation.
                  Thus, we have opted to not use any nitrogen-deficient medium. This does not affect our proof of concept as in both
                  cases, we are only interested in the relative values of the yield and composition of the fatty acids

                  The genetically modified organisms were used exclusively for laboratory-scale biosynthesis and were never intended for

              <h3>Institutional Biosafety Compliance</h3>
              <p>
                All experimental procedures involving recombinant DNA and genetically modified microorganisms were conducted under the
                guidance of our Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBSC). Experimental protocols were reviewed to ensure compliance with
                institutional biosafety regulations, including appropriate containment, handling, and waste disposal practices.
              </p>
              <h3>GMO Containment and Handling</h3>
              <p style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>To prevent accidental exposure or environmental release, the following practices were implemented:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  All experiments involving engineered S. cerevisiae and E. coli were performed using Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1)
                  laboratory practices.
                </li>
                <li>Microbial cultures were maintained only within designated laboratory workspaces.</li>
                <li>
                  Standard aseptic techniques were followed during cloning, transformation, culturing, and downstream processing to
                  minimize contamination.
                </li>
                <li>Live genetically modified microorganisms will never be incorporated into the final coolant formulation.</li>
                <li>
                  Following experimentation, all biological cultures, contaminated media, pipette tips, microcentrifuge tubes, and
                  disposable materials were sterilized by autoclaving before disposal in accordance with IBSC guidelines.
                </li>

              <h3>Laboratory Practices</h3>
              <p style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
                To maintain a safe working environment, all team members adhered to standard laboratory practices, including:

                <li>Proper labeling and secure storage of biological samples, plasmids, and chemical reagents.</li>
                <li>Maintaining accurate records of all recombinant DNA constructs and microbial cultures to ensure traceability.</li>

              <h3>Fire Safety</h3>
              <p />
              <h3>DATA CENTER COOLANT SAFETY AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS</h3>
              <p>
                To ensure that our bio-coolant is suitable for practical deployment, its formulation was developed with reference to
                internationally recognized engineering and safety guidelines. The proposed coolant was evaluated against the general
                recommendations of the Open Compute Project (OCP) for liquid cooling systems, while its physicochemical properties were
                considered in accordance with relevant ASTM International testing standards. Fire safety considerations were referenced
                from NFPA 30 (Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code). Collectively, these guidelines emphasize key requirements such as
                high flash point, thermal stability, controlled viscosity, material compatibility, low electrical conductivity, and
                environmental safety, all of which were considered during the design of our bio-coolant.
              </p>
              <h3>Risk Assessment</h3>
              <p>
                The overall biological risk associated with this project is considered low, as it employs non-pathogenic laboratory
                strains under BSL-1 containment and does not involve hazardous pathogens or toxins. Furthermore, the final bio-coolant
                will not contain any viable genetically modified organisms, significantly reducing biosafety concerns during storage,
                transportation, and eventual application.
              </p>
              <p style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
                By integrating biosafety considerations from strain selection through product development, our project aligns with both
                iGEM safety expectations and institutional biosafety requirements, ensuring that innovation is accompanied by responsible
                and safe engineering practices.
